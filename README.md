## Game Rules

Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns to place their symbols (usually "X" and "O") on the grid. The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends when one player achieves this or when the grid is full, resulting in a draw.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

2. Players take turns to make a move. A move consists of choosing an empty cell and placing your symbol in it.

3. The game continues until one player wins or the grid is full.

4. A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The game will announce the winner.

5. If all cells are filled and no player has three symbols in a row, the game ends in a draw.

6. After the game ends, you can choose to play again or exit the game.
